- Always keep the README.md up to date
- Debug visualisations: padding (blue), margin (red), border (green), gap (purple), clip rect (red), content-area (yellow)
- Always use conventional commit messages
- Always make commit messages short and precise
- Aim for extremely performant, should always run above 500 FPS unless it's a very complex scene.
- FitContent is default dimension, so don't specify it explicitly.
- If you want a node to have rect shape, then don't no anything, it will default to that.
- Always use .with_style to style nodes, not the StyledRect or StyledTriangle directly, it will be applied automatically. And if you want to force a specific shape, then just use the default builder .with_shape(Shape::triangle(...)) or any other shape builder.
